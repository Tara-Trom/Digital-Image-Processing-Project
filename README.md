## Digital-Image-Processing-Project

# Final Project: Use image processing approaches to solve or improve a solution to a
problem of interest, of your choice, as discussed in class. Reports and presentations
should be prepared in groups, but everything must be submitted individually. Projects will
be graded based on performance, difficulty and technical merit, quality of written reports
and presentations.

# Due dates and specifics:
Group Members/Project Title/Project Description: Due 3/24
Final Reports: Due 4/26 (max 8 pages, excluding figures/captions/references/appendix)
Presentations: 4/19 & 4/26 (20 minutes each, equally distributed among members)

# Please include for all reports and presentations:

2. Introduction: Introduce your project, provide background, why is it important, what
related work exists, motivation and goal/objectives (“what” was done and “why” was it
done?)
3. Methods: Describes methodology, your approach/algorithms (“how” was it done?)
which IP approaches were used; what are your performance measures/criteria;
include a flow diagram to help communicate the architecture/process (in Presentations
and Reports); be very clear about what you started with and what you added.
4. Results: Include screen shots for each key aspect/concept, use cases...
5. Discussion & Conclusion: Summarize major points, any weaknesses, provide
interpretation, what is the “take-home” message?
6. Workload distribution: Who did what, % effort levels.
7. References: Documentation and code.
8. Appendix: Source images, all code & results.
